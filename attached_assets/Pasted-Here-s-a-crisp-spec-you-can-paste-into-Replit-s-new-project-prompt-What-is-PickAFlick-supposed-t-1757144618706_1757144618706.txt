Here’s a crisp spec you can paste into Replit’s “new project” prompt.

What is PickAFlick supposed to do?

A simple movie picker web app. It shows:

75 posters: exactly 15 random movies per IMDb list (from the five lists below).

6 trailer recommendations: randomly chosen from all remaining movies (i.e., cannot be any of the 75 poster picks).

Only these IMDb lists are used (no fallbacks, no legacy sources):

https://www.imdb.com/list/ls094921320/

https://www.imdb.com/list/ls003501243/

https://www.imdb.com/list/ls002065120/

https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000873904/

https://www.imdb.com/list/ls005747458/

All artwork and trailers come from TMDb (posters/backdrops via path; trailers via /movie/{id}/videos → YouTube).

What features should it have?

Data ingest/build (server)

Scrape each of the 5 IMDb lists (all items).

Resolve each title + year to TMDb id via /search/movie.

Hydrate details via /movie/{id}?append_to_response=credits to get reliable genres, poster/backdrop.

Randomly sample 15 per list for the Posters section (75 total).

Build a Rec Pool = All Movies − Posters (75).

API endpoints

GET /api/catalogue → returns the 75 posters (flat).

Optional ?grouped=1 → 15-per-list grouped response.

GET /api/recs?limit=6 → returns 6 random items from the Rec Pool (no overlap with posters).

GET /api/trailers?ids=1,2,3 → { [id]: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/…" | null } (match Trailer/Teaser/Official/Clip).

GET /api/catalogue-all → simple health snapshot (counts).

Set no-store headers on recs/trailers/catalogue to avoid caching bugs.

Client (React)

On load: fetch the 75 posters and render the existing poster grid.

Fetch 6 recs, then fetch trailers for those ids and render the trailer strip (show “Trailer unavailable” if null—don’t filter them out).

Optional “Shuffle” button to re-roll posters and recs (simply refetch).

Config/ops

Secrets: TMDB_API_KEY (required).

Optional: CATALOGUE_TTL_HOURS=24 to rebuild cache once a day.

Prod scripts: "build": "tsc -b && vite build", "start:prod": "NODE_ENV=production node dist/server/index.js".

Mount /api before static and catch-all routes.

What type of application?

A web app:

Server: Node.js + Express (TypeScript).

Client: React + Vite (TypeScript).

Deployment: Replit. app.listen(Number(process.env.PORT||3000), "0.0.0.0").

Design preferences / requirements

Do not change the current UI layout (keep poster grid + trailer iframe strip).

Dark, minimalist styling; clean, responsive poster grid; simple trailer carousel/strip.

Posters from TMDb images; trailers are YouTube embeds from TMDb videos.

Keep iframes stable; if you use React keys, include a simple reroll token so trailers remount on shuffle.

No user auth, no A/B testing, no learning—pure random V1.
